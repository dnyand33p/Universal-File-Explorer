# Universal-File-Explorer

A Cross platform application (iOS, Windows, Linux, Android, Web) which will access files on device &amp; local network -> provide a means to browse &amp; view them with same interface and from single device.

## Why we need it?

* We all have multiple devices, which are often connected to a same network yet if you ought to access laptops data from mobile we have to transfer that data. 

## What it will be?

*  We can do better, with same looking app on every device stream data from one to other device, without need of copying, 
*  We can have a custom folder structure (link to saved URIs on all devices.). A custom pdf viewer, a small note taking cum webpage bookmarking cum to-do app (rendering . MD format), a video player cum video slicer, and an image viewer with annotator. 
*  Ability such as - accessing cloud stored files with it's APIs won't be added. As we want this app to work offline only (for privacy & security concerns).

## Choosing the development stack.

* Electron would have been fine (but it will slow down things) --> GoLang community is coming up with it's own UI kits but they are in beta.
* Dark SDK is optimized enough across all platform. Language easy to adapt and We will take some ready made stuff from flutter -- but no animations. 
* Dart & Flutter's plugins will make our path shorter.
