# How should we approach towards learning and building.

*Knowledge is knowing something and doing something based on that knowledge.*

## Learning

* We shouldn't read books or walk through a tutorial, we should start learning & building as a team.
* Google, StackOverflow, Official Documentation, Blog articles and some cooking receipts are enough to build a hobby project. All we need is dedication, consistency & responsibleness.
* [Lets work in team.](https://medium.com/flutter-community/dependency-injection-in-flutter-f19fb66a0740)

  + If you don't know what to do, you can discuss and decide. 
  + If you don't know how to do something, you can search and ask where you need help in it.
  + If you don't understand A, maybe it's because you don't know B, you can learn B by knowing C. A -> B -> C.
  + By feeding back this knowledge of B and C, you will get A. But we need to focus and intent to do so. (We are getting too distracted by stimulations provided by larger, money oriented organizations.)

### What we will get from this.

* An experience towards approaching a development.
* Socializing with like-minded but diverse personals.
* Learning how to learn and build.
* Helping each other and improving our communication.
* A hobby project to put on resume. (This will never be commercialized.)
* How to write documented, organized, understandable & testable code.

**We are not allowed to watch a course or read a book for this. Searching, reading and discussing (watching small tutorial videos) is enough**
